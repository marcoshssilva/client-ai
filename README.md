# Client-AI

A simple Spring Boot application that uses [Spring AI](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai) to communicate to AI models in [Azure using OpenAI Models](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service).

My intention is to explore the full potential of generative AI using Spring Boot and various models like Chatgpt, Copilot, llama3, or any others.

## Requirements

- **Only for OpenIA using Azure**: OpenAI endpoint and key in Azure with previously deployment to chat, image and text-to-speech (at least one deployment to each)
- **Only for OpenIA platform**: OpenAI Key with recharged credits to make requests
- JDK Java v21
- Maven v3+
